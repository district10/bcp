bcp
===

bcp via CMake. Tested on Win+VS2010(x64).

-   BOOST headers, libs: <http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/2016/boost_1_58_0-vs2010x64.7z> (99.7 MB)
-   bcp binary

    +   <http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/2016/bcp.exe> (565 KB)
    +   <http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/2016/bcp_standalone> (2.28 MB), checkout `standalone` branch

If you don't have Boost installed, you can try `standalone branch`, but I can't
guarantee it will works. (Not work on my Win7+VS2010, work on my Ubuntu+GCC)
